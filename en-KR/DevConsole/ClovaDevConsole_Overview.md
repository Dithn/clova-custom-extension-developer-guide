# Clova developer console overview

Clova developer console is a web tool providing required information or functions for developing devices or services that connect with the Clova platform. A client developer enters the information of the client (device or app) he or she wishes to develop through the Clova developer console and sets up the security information to enable the corresponding client to access CIC. An extension developer [enters the extension information](/DevConsole/Guides/Register_Custom_Extension.md) and [registers an interaction model](/DevConsole/Guides/Register_Interaction_Model.md) to allow exchange of messages between the CEK and extension. Also, an extension developer must test the extension and request an extension review for [extension deployment](/DevConsole/Guides/Deploy_Custom_Extension.md).

When developing clients or extensions, the Clova developer console is used in the following structure:

Operations such as registering, deploying, updating, disabling, or deleting an extension will be performed through the Clova developer console as shown above. This operation is related to the lifecycle of an extension, and the lifecycle of an extension in the Clova developer console is shown in the figure below.

You can register and manage custom extensions through the CEK menu of [Clova developer console](/DevConsole/ClovaDevConsole_Overview.md). You can also test the custom extension or the interaction model by connecting with [CEK](/Develop/CEK_Overview.md#WhatisCEK). Click the **Clova Extensions Kit Î²** menu on the left or the hamburger menu in the center to go to the CEK menu as shown below.
