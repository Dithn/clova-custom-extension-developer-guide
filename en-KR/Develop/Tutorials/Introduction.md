# Tutorial
To link your service with Clova, you must develop an extension. This tutorial uses [DiceDrawer](/Develop/Examples/Extension_Examples.md#DiceDrawer) as an example in a step-by-step process to help developers become familiar with development for Clova.

The Dice Drawer extension is an extension that rolls dice and shows the results.
For the purpose of this tutorial, we will create an extension with the name "Sample Dice" to avoid any confusion with "DiceDrawer," which is currently in service.

The user can use the Sample Dice as follows:

{% include "/Develop/Tutorials/BasicInformation/DICE_Sample_Dialog.md" %}

If you follow this tutorial, you will learn the following:

* [Second tutorial: Handling basic built-in intents, such as "yes" or "no"](/Develop/Tutorials/Handle_Builtin_Intents.md)
* [Third tutorial: Utilizing user input information](/Develop/Tutorials/Use_Builtin_Type_Slots.md)
